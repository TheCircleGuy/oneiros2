This creation symbolizes an ethereal beauty, one that can only be wished for but never touched.<br>Like stars in the sky, like the moon in the water, the fragrance of Water Moon is peaceful and dreamy, floating delicately on the skin.<br>There is no specific description of Water Moon, as what it holds is too personal, like a fleeting reverie in the human world.",
